# U.S. Flight Cancellation Analysis

### Investigation Overview

Flight cancellations are frustrating. They are an unfortunate risk to all air travel. But can you reduce the risk that your flight will be cancelled by choosing a specific carrier, location or time of travel?

Utilizing graphical techniques, an analysis has been conducted of all commercial 21st Century flights in the U.S. using the The Bureau of Transportation Statistics records from 2001 to 2007. The analysis focussed on flight cancellations to elucidate potential answers to the above question, help inform the traveller prior to making their booking and perhaps encourage airlines and/or airports to improve their performance.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from 2001 to 2007. This is a large dataset with nearly 47 million records in total and takes up almost 6 gigabytes of hard disk space.

The original dataset has 29 columns. However, for the purpose of this analysis, to understand causes of flight cancellations, the dataset has been trimmed to only hold the year, month, day of week and scheduled departure time of flight, the airline, the departure airport, whether the flight was cancelled and the reason for cancellation including carrier, weather, National Aviation System or security.

### Conclusions

The number of flights and flight cancellations in the U.S. between 2001 and 2007 increased. Crucially, so had the percentage of flights cancelled suggesting the industry was not improving in this factor.

Flight cancellations were more likely during Winter months, during the working week and in the early morning or late afternoon.

Major international airports had a higher proportion of flight cancellations with LaGuardia, Chicago O'Hare and Newark being the worse performing.

All U.S. airlines had increased their percentage of flights cancelled between 2003 and 2007 with United Air Lines, Atlantic Southeast Airlines and JetBlue Airways having the greatest increases.
